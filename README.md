# HDLO2416-Driver-for-Arduino
A simple Arduino based driver for HDLO 2416 displays

Though not very sophisticated yet, its a decent beginning to using an old HDLO-2416 Display with an Arduino.

This code does not yet implement:
  1. Scrolling text
  2. Multiple displays
  3. Fast / Compact code
  4. Strings of text
  
But it does implement:
  1. Using all four characters on a display to show numbers
  2. Showing a single character on a selectable segment (Could show a 4 letter string, but rather obscure).
